# DoubleGeneds
Java Project to get a list of "Double Gen Eds"

Satisfying General Education requirements in college can be a pain, and when I realized that some 'geneds' can satisfy two
category requirements, I was excited. However, there is no list of such GenEds on Spire, the course registration system my 
school uses. Also, some GenEds are not offered every semester. So, I printed a PDF of the list of all geneds offered over the 
year from the school website, and made a Java program that filtered double geneds from single geneds.
