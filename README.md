# DoubleGeneds
Java Project to get a list of "Double Gen Eds"

Satisfying General Education requirements in college can be a pain, and when I realized that some 'geneds' can satisfy two
category requirements, I was excited. However, there is no list of such GenEds on Spire, the course registration system my 
school uses. Also, some GenEds are not offered every semester. So, I printed a PDF of the list of all geneds offered over the 
year from the school website, and made a Java program that filtered double geneds from single geneds. 

A text file was made by copying all the text from the PDF uploaded and pasting it into Notepad. 
The other PDF is the list generated by my Java code.

To run it on your computer, download the Java source file, download the text file for with the list of all GenEds, and execute it in a Java environment. Remember to change the path of the text file in the Java source code to the directory you downnload the text file to.
